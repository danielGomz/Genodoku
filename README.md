# ðŸ§¬ Genodoku â€” Genetic Algorithm Sudoku Solver

**Genodoku** is an experimental Sudoku solver powered by a genetic algorithm. Instead of backtracking or brute force, it evolves populations of candidate solutions until it finds a valid one â€” all while showing its progress in real time.

> ðŸ§© Think of it as Darwin playing Sudoku.

## ðŸ§  How it Works

1. **Input**: Load a puzzle from a CSV file.
2. **Initialization**: Generate a random population of complete boards, respecting the fixed cells.
3. **Evolution**: Over generations:
   - Select the fittest candidates
   - Combine them with crossover
   - Mutate them slightly
   - Keep the elites
4. **Goal**: Reach a Sudoku grid with **no conflicts** in rows, columns, or 3Ã—3 boxes.
